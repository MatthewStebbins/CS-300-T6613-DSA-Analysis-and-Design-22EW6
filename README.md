CS-300-T6613 DSA: Analysis and Design 22EW6


What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
	Input data from a comma separated file, store that data in a data structure, then output the in alphabetical order.
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
	I approached this problem by first figuring out the fastest data structure to load the data into. After finding the Big O value for the data structures I realized that some of the data structures could sort as they data was added leading to a faster runtime since the data is only required to be sorted in one order. By picking the best structure I was able to optimize the run time saving resources.
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
	The only roadblock I had was some logic errors where the data was not getting added to the tree correctly. I used cout statements to see where the code flowed letting me see where the issue was.
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
	This class has helped me understand the utility of programmer designed data structures and the advantage of them over a multi-dimensional array.
